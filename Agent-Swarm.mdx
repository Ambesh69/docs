The chads who work relentlessly to make your DeFi journey more easy and accessible.

Eidoâ€™s agent swarm includes:

- Information Agent: Discovers and explains high-yield opportunities (low/high risk, stablecoins, leverage plays).
- Strategy Agent: Breaks down strategy risk/reward and simulates yield outcomes.
- Risk Profiling Agent: Analyzes wallet data \+ manual input to match strategies to personal risk appetite.
- Execution Agent: Executes trades, LPs, and governance actions via an embedded wallet.
- Monitoring Agent: Tracks yield decay, impermanent loss, bribes, and alerts for rebalancing.
- Beranance (Governance) Agent: Optimizes BGT delegation, voting, and bribe-maximization.

Our Agents job doesn't end here, it goes beyond your expectations & imagination:

- Mobile App: Seamless mobile-first DeFi access, with agent chat UI and push notifications.
- Lending & Borrowing Integrations: Integrate protocols like Dolomite and future Berachain-native lending/borrowing markets for capital efficiency.
- Automated Yield Compounding: Auto-compound yields \+ rebalance into top-performing pools to maximize returns.
- Custom Agent Marketplace: A dedicated marketplace where developers and advanced users can create, publish, and monetize custom agents that plug into the EIDO ecosystem (e.g., Targeting niche DeFi strategies, Automated tax reporting, DAO tooling, or Cross-chain yield farming)
- Prompt-based Automation: Users will be able to type natural language prompts (e.g., "Move my HONEY yields into the safest farm") and EIDO will design and execute multi-step flows automatically.
- Cross-Chain Liquidity Management: Multi-chain strategy orchestration with on-chain messaging bridges.
- Advanced Risk Simulator: Interactive simulations showing projected risk/reward across various market scenarios, inspired by best-in-class UX
