**What is Eido?**\
Eido is a DeFAI swarm on berachain built to automate defi strategies using simple prompts. The swarm acts as a decentralized "intelligent advisor" optimizing yields, minimizing impermanent loss, and driving sustainable liquidity growth for Berachain’s ecosystem.\
**\
How does Eido improve the way people use crypto right now?**\
Eido’s agent swarm helps users from information to execution. \
Exploring a new ecosystem? Eido will be your guide to understanding core primitives, opportunities (risk adjusted) and also execute it for you if you wish to deploy capital.\
\
It basically abstracts the entire ecosystem into single intelligence which users can access using basic prompts. \
\
**Do I need to create a separate wallet to interact with Eido?**\
Yes, Eido creates an embedded wallet whenever a user signs up. Once signed up, user needs to delegate the wallet which was created to the agent to handle execution. \
\
**Does Eido charge any fee?**\
No, Eido doesn’t charge any fee right now. It might change in the future.\
\
**Does Eido support all berachain protocols?**\
No, Eido doesn’t support all berachain protocols. To start with, you can swap using eido (we’ve integrated ooga booga to power it) and stake iBGT on infrared. We are constantly working on new integrations.\
\
**Got a cool use for EIDO’s logo? Where do I grab the Brand Kit?**\
