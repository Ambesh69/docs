title: "Eido Labs - One intelligent action at a time"

Eido Labs is building Big Bera Model (BBM), a swarm of AI agents that makes DeFi accessible, safe, and intuitive, starting with Berachain. EIDOâ€™s mission is simple: empower users to navigate complex DeFi opportunities effortlessly, whether they're crypto natives or curious newcomers.\
\
DeFi on new chains like Berachain is complex, especially for degens or casual users who want access to high-yield opportunities but struggle with understanding where to farm, how Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) works, or even how to manage risk. The traditional LP experience is fragmented & scattered across multiple protocols, volatile markets, and governance layers. Many users miss out on high-quality yield farms or bribe mechanics because they can't stay on top of the moving parts. EIDO is tackling this by creating an intelligent swarm of agents that simplifies every step from risk assessment to execution, all based on wallet history and user goals.

The BBM is a decentralized, intelligent agent system built to automate, personalize, and optimize liquidity provisioning across Berachain. At its heart are five key agents: Risk Profiling Agent (assesses user risk level via wallet behavior or manual input), Strategy Optimization Agent (builds dynamic yield strategies across PoL protocols like BEX and Kodiak), Execution Agent (handles swaps, liquidity provisioning, and deposits), Monitoring Agent (tracks impermanent loss, BGT emissions, and rebalances accordingly), and Governance Agent (votes and delegates BGT to maximize bribes and emissions). Each agent works together in real-time via a modular orchestration layer powered by LangGraph, making the swarm adaptive and context-aware.
