title: "Points Reward System"
description: "One of our core beliefs in what makes a successful protocol is the community that stands behind it and thus we'll be airdropping 3% of $EIDO supply to our early users and adopters."
---

We reward early adopters and contributors via:

- **Explore-to-Earn:** Points for completing missions, making first move, using agents, testing strategies.
- **Refer-to-Earn:** Invite friends, earn bonuses.
- **Boost Multipliers:** Earn extra for governance participation, staking, and testing high-risk/high-reward vaults.

Points are allocated and distributed based on the Badge-Tier system designed by the team.
