**Multi-Hierarchical Agent Swarm Architecture**

- Implemented using LangGraph for orchestration and state management across agents
- Separation of concerns with dedicated agents (Risk, Strategy, Execution, Monitoring, Governance) operating independently yet collaboratively
- Built-in redundancy and fallback mechanisms to prevent hallucinations and ensure reliability
- Agent communication via message-passing protocol with validation layers

**Generative UI with Dynamic Component Rendering**

- Real-time UI components generated based on current DeFi state and user actions
- Transaction preview and simulation before execution
- Adaptive interface that adjusts complexity based on user expertise level
- Integrated wallet connection widgets and transaction status tracking

**Advanced Thread-Based Context Management**

- Persistent conversation threads maintaining full transaction history and decision context
- Multi-session memory allowing agents to learn from past interactions
- Context window optimization for efficient token usage
- Vector database integration for semantic search across historical interactions

**Embedded Wallet Infrastructure**

- Account abstraction for gasless transactions and improved UX
- Social recovery and multi-signature support for enhanced security
- Seamless onboarding with email/social login options
- Cross-chain compatibility preparation for future expansion

**Fine-tuned LLM Stack**

- Custom-trained models on Berachain documentation, protocols, and PoL mechanics
- Specialized tokenizers for DeFi terminology and blockchain addresses
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline for real-time protocol updates
- Continuous learning from on-chain data and user interactions

**Event-Driven Architecture**

- Real-time blockchain event listeners for price updates, emissions, and governance proposals
- Webhook integration for external protocol notifications
- Message queue system for reliable agent-to-agent communication
- Circuit breakers and rate limiting for API protection

**Modular Plugin System**

- Extensible architecture supporting new protocols and chains
- Standardized interfaces for third-party integrations
- Protocol-specific adapters for BEX, Kodiak, and other Berachain DEXs

At the core of Eido is the BBM—an orchestrated swarm of agents specialized across DeFi user flows:\
\
- Risk Profiling Agent: Understands a user’s risk appetite via wallet data or manual input.\
- Strategy Optimization Agent: Builds yield-maximizing strategies based on real-time data and PoL emissions.\
- Execution Agent: Handles swaps, LP provisioning, and BGT staking via embedded wallet.\
- Monitoring Agent: Observes yield decay, impermanent loss, and triggers rebalances.\
- Governance Agent: Delegates BGT, votes on protocol upgrades, and detects bait bribes.\
These agents operate in sync via LangGraph, integrating seamlessly with Berachain-native protocols like BEX, Kodiak, Honeypot, Infrared, and more.
