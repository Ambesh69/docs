**<u>Token Utility:</u>**

**<u>1. Train Agent Swarms (Cubs):</u>**\
- Users can mint a base agent ("Shell") by paying in \$EIDO.\
- To specialize the agent (e.g., into Strategy, Risk, Execution, Tax Agents), they upload data sets (wallet history, DeFi goals, onchain performance), and pay **training gas** in \$EIDO.\
\
Agent specialization examples:\
- Strategy Agent = trained to discover high APR strategies on Berachain\
- Risk Agent = trained to warn users on bribe volatility or impermanent loss\
- Execution Agent = trained to auto-compound or rebalance

**<u>2. Submit & Monetize High-Yield Strategies:</u>**

- Builders/farmers can **submit DeFi strategies** (e.g., bribe-max loops, auto compounding flows, best farming/staking strategies) by paying a small fee in \$EIDO.\
- Strategies are then available in a marketplace. Anyone using the strategy pays in \$EIDO, which gets split between:

- Strategy Creator (e.g., 40%)
- Eido Treasury (e.g., 30%)
- Agent Trainers (e.g., 30%)

**<u>3. Agent-as-a-Service Licensing</u>**

**- **DAOs, protocols, or pro users can **license trained Eido Agents** (e.g., a Risk Agent trained for BeraLend bribes) by paying in \$EIDO.\
- Licensed agents can be used to plug into third-party UIs, bots, dashboards.

**<u>4. Incentivized Staking & Delegation</u>**

Stake \$EIDO to:

- **Get early access** to strategies and advanced agents
- Earn passive \$EIDO from ecosystem usage (rev share pool)
- Vote in governance or delegate to Agent Validators

(Note: Staking for \$EIDO will be launched later. \$EIDO stakers will be eligible for future rewards based on the partnerships eido labs execute)

**<u>5. Swarm fees & Governance (TBA):</u>**

\$EIDO will be the primary token through which users will take part in the eido swarm. \$EIDO will be used as a revenue generation token.Â 

**<u>6. Token buybacks:</u>**

Fees from the EIDO swarm will be used to buyback \$EIDO
